### Simon says

This is a fully deployed game of "Simon says", play against your Friends and everyone who got the url.
Your task is to name the colors in the right order exactly as Simon says. With each round it will be one color more you need to name.
An example would be:
<ol> 
    <li>1. Round: red 
    </li>
    <li>2. Round: red, yellow 
    </li>
    <li>3. Round: red, yellow, yellow 
    </li>
    <li>4. Round: red, yellow, yellow, blue 
    </li>
    <li>5. Round: red, yellow, yellow, blue, green.
    </li>
</ol>
This continues indefinitely until you name a wrong order of colors. Your maximum of Rounds will be sent to the Highscore sheet.
Try to beat your own highscore or try to beat the one of your friends. With three different difficulties and every difficulty has its own rankings.

# Three different difficulties
The game allows you to play on three different difficulties. Each shortens the time you have to memorize the new color in your sequence.
You can play on "easy" difficulty. Which gives you 2 seconds of time.
You can play on "medium" difficulty. Which gives you 1 second of time.
If you want the ultimate challenge, you can play on "hard" difficulty. This only gives you 0.3 seconds of time.

# Highscores
The game will track how many rounds you beat succesfully and rank them accordingly. Every difficulty has its own rankings.

# Track your ranking.
If you want to know who was better you or your friend. You can always check the Highscores in the Terminal there will be the top 10 Player listed with name and succesful rounds.

# Replay immediately
If you lose, you can start a new Round immediately without the program exiting.

# Features left to implement
Another Idea which could increase the difficulties for hard and even medium would be, to show a different color, than the written one. 

## Testing

I tested the program throughout every phase of its development.
